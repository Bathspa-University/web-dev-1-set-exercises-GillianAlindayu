            The Chronicles of Narnia, written by famous author, C.S. Lewis, are stories about a mystical kingdom called Narnia, where animals coexists
            with people, witches fight battle, and dragons and horses ride overhead. It's a world where hunting teams ride seahorses and silvers can heal
            individuals. To readers looking for more than a fairy tale about an imagined and a magical realm, The Chronicles of Narnia may also be seen 
            as a Christian allegory, with Aslan, the great talking lion, representing Christ. The destruction of Narnia has been likened to a apocalpse 
            In addition to fairy tale and Christian aspects, the Chronicles of Narnia include incidents from the author's life.
